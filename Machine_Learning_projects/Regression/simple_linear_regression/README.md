#Simple Linear Regression Algorithm

This repository(directory) consists of Applied Machine learning projects that solves various Business problems

Most of these algorithms were part of machine learning a-z course on udemy. I am using github to upload what i have learnt from Instructor


Business Problem: To find out correlation between Salary and  Years of Experience using Simple linear regression Machine learning Algorithm



What is the best Business value that can be added to compmny ,
how to set the salaries for new employee by understanding the current underlying  model using the dataset Salary_Data.csv
For future the company can use the underlying modl  and can predict the salary range for new employee as per his/her experience
